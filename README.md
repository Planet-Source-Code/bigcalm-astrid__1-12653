### Description

A demo of the A* (A star) pathing algorithm used in many games to find a path across a varied map. This is merely a demo, but with optimisation it could be modified to be used in a game. Most tiled map games, board games (such as chess), and route finders all use the A* pathing algorithm as a quick an efficient method of finding a route from A to B.

The code also contains my implementation of a Heap or Binary Tree (which is sadly lacking from VB).
 
### More Info
 
A* is based on graph theory, and has many implementations. Numerous links are included in the code for the user to find out more
